# CodingTestNov23
This is a mini project created to show some basic coding skills for a coding test.
It is meant to mimic a store where you are able to select from a range of items, select how many of each items, geta  ruinning total for bnasket cost and then allow fora  discount code at the end.

In order to improve this i would add some unit testing and add more interactivity with the basket.
Similarly, i would also creata  more user friendly interface and move to a web app.

This project was completed under instructions of a short time frame of no more than a couple hours and with personal life getting in the way.
